# `include` directory

This directory includes all the header files for the compiler.

The files in this directory are:
- `lexer.h`: the header file defining the Token struct and the Lexer class
- `parser.h`: the header file defining the ASTNode class and the Lexer class
- `README.md`: this admittedly unhelpful file
